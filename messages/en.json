Upon finding your dream property, you'll enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the seller. This MOU sets the stage for the Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA), which outlines the terms of the deal. A deposit, usually 10% of the total purchase price, is exchanged during the MOU signing. If financing is involved, the bank assesses the property's value before advancing the funds. The NOC from the developer confirms the completion of payments, and the SPA signing formalizes the ownership transfer."
