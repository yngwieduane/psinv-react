        "Trust and experience are the main reason for choosing an exclusive agreement with Exotiq. Owners nowadays realize how complex it has become to successfully sell a property in Bali, particularly, if owned by a foreigner. It requires not only extensive knowhow in selling luxury properties, but also solid knowledge of legal and fiscal matters, something that only comes with years of experience. Founded in 2002, Exotiq is Baliâ€™s oldest real estate agency.",
